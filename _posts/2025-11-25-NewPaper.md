#newpaper #collaboration 
Excited to share new work on a role of TOP2 in RNA metabolism, a great collaboration we were part of!

This work shows that TOP2B not only maintains basal RNA Polymerase II transcription elongation on paused genes but also promotes METTL3 recruitment, stimulating co-transcriptional N6-adenosine (m6A) methylation of nascent RNAs and their rapid degradation.

This mechanism is crucial to keep paused genes in check, reducing overall gene expression output while maintaining the right environment for their activation upon stimulation.

The study was led by PhD student Clara Megías-Fernández from Silvia Jimeno-González group (University of Seville), who visited our lab at Małopolska Centre of Biotechnology UJ to carry out key TT-seq experiments.
