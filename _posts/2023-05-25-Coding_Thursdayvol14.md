rMATS outputs several files, including txt files for all considered splicing events (i.e. SE (skipped exon), MXE (mutually exclusive exons), A3SS (alternative 3' splice site), A5SS (alternative 5' splice site), RI (retained intron)). There are two versions of these files, with exentsions JC or JCEC, which include only reads that span junctions or both reads that span junctions and reads that do not cross an exon boundary; respectively.
