    Magda is an experimental biologist and a budding bioinformatician. She graduated from Jagiellonian University. She then did her PhD studies in cancer biology. 
    In her last post, she was a postdoc at the Caceres Lab at the University of Edinburgh. Having received funding from NCN and NAWA, she moved to Poznan
    to set up her own lab.
    Runner, climber and a mum in her spare time.

   Bogna received her MSc degree in medical biotechnology from Poznan University of Medical Sciences. During her master thesis research, she worked on the use of bioengineered silk in 
   cancer drug delivery. Next she joined the group of Rafal Ciosk at Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, where she studied the molecular mechanism of mRNA 
   silencing by specific RNA-binding proteins. Subsequently, she worked in the project focused on creating platform for better diagnosis and therapy of different diseases. 
   In September 2022, she joined Magda Maslon’s group as a lab manager, where she not only ensures that the lab runs smootly, but also does experimental work on transcription kinetics.
   She loves dogs, food and exploring new cultures.

    Shraddha earned her Master's degree in Microbiology from Pune University, India. Her Master’s thesis was on cytokine signaling in macrophages, where  worked on IL-12 (Interleukin 12) and 
    IL- 10 (Interleukin 10) signaling in Leishmania parasite infection. After her MSc, she joined TMC-ACTREC, to identify expression levels of certain biomarkers (EGFR, COX-2, HIF1A, etc) 
    in cancer cells. Now as a doctoral student in the Maslon lab, she is trying to understand the complexities of RNAPII elongation rate modulation in neurodevelopment. 
    Besides her academic interests, she keeps herself busy with painting: watercolors & gouache, charcoal, sketching human anatomy, soft pastels, acrylics, and oil paint.  She reads non-fiction 
    books, loves photography and playing with the lens. Being from Mumbai, she is obsessed with strolling on the streets of Poznan like a maniac, exploring museums, art shops, bookstores, cafes, 
    and trying coffee, and baked products!
