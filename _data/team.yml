    Magda is an experimental biologist and a budding bioinformatician. She graduated from Jagiellonian University. She then did her PhD studies in cancer biology. 
    In her last post, she was a postdoc at the Caceres Lab at the University of Edinburgh. Having received funding from NCN and NAWA, she moved to Poznan
    to set up her own lab.
    Runner, climber and a mum in her spare time.

   Bogna received her MSc degree in medical biotechnology from Poznan University of Medical Sciences. During her master thesis research, she worked on the use of bioengineered silk in 
   cancer drug delivery. Next she joined the group of Rafal Ciosk at Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, where she studied the molecular mechanism of mRNA 
   silencing by specific RNA-binding proteins. Subsequently, she worked in the project focused on creating platform for better diagnosis and therapy of different diseases. 
   In September 2022, she joined Magda Maslonâ€™s group as a lab manager, where she not only ensures that the lab runs smootly, but also does experimental work on transcription kinetics.
   She loves dogs, food and exploring new cultures.

   Ola is an MSc biotechnology student at the Adam Mickiewicz University. She did her bachelor thesis on "The involvement of the protein import machinery in the course of Parkinson's disease". 
   Recently, she joined Maslon group to do her master thesis. She will develop and characterize a cellular model of RNA polymerase II with increased elongation rate. 
   During her free time, she likes to explore new places by travelling to various countries and photography landscapes.
