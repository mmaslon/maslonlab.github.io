   Bogna received her MSc degree in medical biotechnology from Poznan University of Medical Sciences. During her master thesis research, she worked on the use of bioengineered silk in 
   cancer drug delivery. Next she joined the group of Rafal Ciosk at Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, where she studied the molecular mechanism of mRNA 
   silencing by specific RNA-binding proteins. She also worked in the project focused on creating platform for better diagnosis and therapy of different diseases. 
   In September 2022, she joined Magda Maslonâ€™s group as a lab manager, where she not only ensures that the lab runs smootly, but also does experimental work on transcription kinetics.
   She loves dogs, food and exploring new cultures.
