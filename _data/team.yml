    Shraddha earned her Master's degree in Microbiology from Pune University, India. Her Master’s thesis was on cytokine signaling in macrophages, where  worked on IL-12 (Interleukin 12) and 
    IL- 10 (Interleukin 10) signaling in Leishmania parasite infection. After her MSc, she joined TMC-ACTREC, to identify expression levels of certain biomarkers (EGFR, COX-2, HIF1A, etc) 
    in cancer cells. Now as a doctoral student in the Maslon lab, she is trying to understand the complexities of RNAPII elongation rate modulation in neurodevelopment. 
    Besides her academic interests, she keeps herself busy with painting: watercolors & gouache, charcoal, sketching human anatomy, soft pastels, acrylics, and oil paint.  She reads non-fiction 
    books, loves photography and playing with the lens. Being from Mumbai, she is obsessed with strolling on the streets of Poznan like a maniac, exploring museums, art shops, bookstores, cafes, 
    and trying coffee, and baked products!
